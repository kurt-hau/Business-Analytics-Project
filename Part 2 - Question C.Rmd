## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

# **Problem we want to solve:**

Determine which products may be no longer worth selling. This includes products that have a high cost of goods, but are not purchased as often (low revenue).

## Step 1: Group by each specific product and collect all the relevant columns and create totals for each of them

```{r cars}
library(dplyr)

# Aggregate data by product_name to get total units, total revenue, and total costs
product_summary <- df_clean_etl %>%
  group_by(product_name) %>%
  summarise(
    total_units = sum(units, na.rm = TRUE),            # Total units sold, per product
    total_revenue = sum(revenue, na.rm = TRUE),        # Total revenue, per product
    total_cost = sum(costs, na.rm = TRUE)              # Total cost of goods sold, per product
  )

```

## Step 2: Group by each specific product and collect all the relevant columns and create totals for each of them

```{r cars}
library(dplyr)

# Aggregate data by product_name to get total units, total revenue, and total costs
product_summary <- df_clean_etl %>%
  group_by(product_name) %>%
  summarise(
    total_units = sum(units, na.rm = TRUE),            # Total units sold, per product
    total_revenue = sum(revenue, na.rm = TRUE),        # Total revenue, per product
    total_cost = sum(costs, na.rm = TRUE)              # Total cost of goods sold, per product
  )

```

## 

## Step 2: Calculate profitability metrics

```{r cars}
# Calculate gross profit and gross margin for each product
product_summary <- product_summary %>%
  mutate(
    gross_profit = total_revenue - total_cost,                     # Gross profit
    gross_margin = (gross_profit / total_revenue) * 100            # Gross margin percentage
  )


```

## Step 3: Identify Low-Frequency, High-Cost Products

```{r cars}
# Set thresholds based on quantiles and averages
low_sales_threshold <- quantile(product_summary$total_units, 0.20)  # Bottom 20% for units sold

# Calculate the average cost per unit across all products
average_cost_per_unit <- mean(df_clean_etl$costs, na.rm = TRUE)

# Filter products that are low frequency (low sales) and high cost
low_sales_high_cost_products <- product_summary %>%
  filter(total_units < average_cost_per_unit & total_cost > average_cost_per_unit)

```

## 

## Step 4: Visualize the results

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure}
library(ggplot2)

# Scatter plot of total units sold vs gross profit
ggplot(product_summary, aes(x = log(total_units), y = log(gross_profit))) +
  geom_point(color = "blue") +
  geom_point(data = low_sales_high_cost_products, color = "red") +  # Highlight the identified products
  labs(
    title = "Profitability vs. Sales Frequency",
    x = "Total Units Sold",
    y = "Gross Profit"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
